"""Segment split & merge logic for Supervertaler Workbench.

Pure, UI-free helpers that operate on a list of Segment-like objects (anything
with ``id``, ``source``, ``target``, ``status``, ``comments`` and the structural
fields ``paragraph_id``, ``file_id``, ``is_table_cell``, ``table_info``,
``category``, ``okapi_tu_id``, ``locked``). They mutate the list in place.

Segments are cloned with ``copy.deepcopy`` so this module never needs to import
the Segment dataclass (which lives in Supervertaler.py).

Eligibility note: the caller is responsible for only invoking these on projects
whose segmentation Supervertaler owns (monolingual DOCX / Okapi / TXT-MD). For
bilingual CAT round-trip formats (sdlxliff, memoQ / Trados / Phrase / Déjà Vu
bilingual, PO) the external tool owns the segment slots, so split/merge must be
disabled — see ``structure_editable`` below.
