Context-sensitive help system for Supervertaler.

Opens the relevant documentation page when the user presses F1
or uses the Help > Context Help menu action.

Usage:
    from modules.help_system import Topics, install, set_topic, open_help

    # Install the event filter on the main window (call once at startup):
    install(main_window)

    # Tag any widget with a help topic:
    set_topic(my_widget, Topics.GLOSSARY_TERMLENS)

    # Open help for a specific topic programmatically:
    open_help(Topics.AI_BATCH)

    The unified help site at https://docs.supervertaler.com (Astro
    Starlight on Cloudflare Pages, sources from the Supervertaler-Help
    repo) uses **folder-based URLs**: every page's URL mirrors its
    on-disk path under ``workbench/`` or ``trados/``. README.md files
    map to the folder root. Trailing slashes are canonical (Astro
    issues 301s from the slashless form, so omitting one still works
    but adds a hop).

    Workbench pages all live under ``workbench/``; Trados pages live
    under ``trados/``. There are no GitBook-style collision suffixes
    (``-1``) because the folder prefix already disambiguates.

    Authoritative URL map: ``src/generated/sidebar.js`` in the
    Supervertaler-Help repo. Regenerate that file with
    ``python _migrate/generate_sidebar.py`` after editing SUMMARY.md
    and the entries here line up 1:1 with the ``link`` fields there.
