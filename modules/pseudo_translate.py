"""Pseudo-translation: fill targets with deliberately stress-tested placeholder
text so a project's files can be exported and visually checked for layout,
encoding, font-coverage and tag round-trip problems BEFORE real translation
starts.

This is the pure, UI-free core (so it can be unit-tested). ``Supervertaler.py``
calls :func:`pseudo_translate_text` once per segment from the Bulk Operations
action and writes the result into each segment's target.

Three things are done to the *visible* words of a segment, all orthogonal:

1. **Tags are preserved verbatim.** Inline tags (HTML/XML, Trados/SDLXLIFF
   numeric, memoQ) are never touched or reordered — only the text between them
   is transformed. If pseudo mangled tags it would invalidate the very tag
   round-trip the export test is meant to verify.
2. **Length expansion.** The text is padded with word-like filler to the
   requested ratio (e.g. ``0.3`` → +30%) to surface overflow, clipped cells,
   reflow and truncation that identical-length copy-source can't.
3. **Character substitution.** Optionally maps letters to accented equivalents
   to exercise diacritics / encoding / font fallback.

Each transformed segment is wrapped in visible boundary markers so a dropped,
merged or misplaced segment is obvious at a glance in the exported file.
